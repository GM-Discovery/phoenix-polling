# Trust Investment Points System: Technical Architecture

## 1. System Overview

The Trust Investment Points System provides the technical foundation for a federated governance model that blends direct and representational democracy. The system enables allocation of trust points upward through multiple validation levels, creating transparent accountability while supporting both individual agency and collective decision-making.

## 2. Core Architecture Components

### 2.1 Federation Model

The architecture follows a federated design resembling a coalition of societies and organizations:
- Individual communities (voting authorities) maintain sovereign instances
- Hierarchical validation flows upward from individuals to voting authorities
- Cross-community recognition occurs through standardized protocols
- Voting authorities can form coalitions to govern larger domains

### 2.2 Data Storage Layer

- **Primary Storage**: Distributed ledger for transparency and integrity
  - User profiles and pseudonymous identities
  - Point allocation history
  - Voting records with review actions
  - Validation hierarchies
  
- **Local Community Instances**:
  - Each voting authority maintains its own database instance
  - Synchronization protocols maintain federation connections
  - Public ledger provides transparent verification

### 2.3 Application Layer

- **Core Application**: Platform supporting:
  - Point allocation and tracking
  - Voting processes
  - Validation transparency
  - Coalition governance
  
- **Mobile/Web Access**: 
  - Cross-platform compatibility
  - Accessible interface design
  - Offline functionality with synchronization

### 2.4 API Services

- **Core API**: Endpoints for:
  - Point allocation and tracking
  - Vote casting and revision
  - Authority registration and validation
  - Ledger access
  
- **Federation API**: Protocols for:
  - Cross-authority recognition
  - Coalition formation
  - Resource sharing
  
- **Analytics API**: Services for:
  - Representative vote tracking
  - Authority override statistics
  - Validation strength visualization

### 2.5 Security Layer

- **Pseudonymous Identity**:
  - Unique identifiers for public ledger
  - Privacy-preserving verification
  - Family linkages for minor management
  
- **Authority Verification**:
  - Organization validation process
  - Coalition consensus security
  - Multi-level approval workflows

### 2.6 Blockchain-Ready Design

The system architecture incorporates foundations for future blockchain integration:

- **Conceptual Alignment**:
  - Public ledger of transactions mirrors blockchain transparency
  - Points as tokenizable social capital
  - Federated consensus mechanisms 
  - Immutable voting record

- **Technical Foundations**:
  - Data structures compatible with distributed ledger technologies
  - Transaction records designed for verification
  - Cryptographic signatures establishing authenticity

## 3. Point System Implementation

### 3.1 Point Allocation Framework

- **Initial Distribution**:
  - Adults receive 1 trust point annually
  - Children receive first point at age 10
  - Parents control children's points until majority/emancipation
  - Additional points earned through education/validation (up to maximum of 10)

- **Allocation Rules**:
  - Up to 1 point per organization
  - Religious/political groups limited to 0.1 points per person
  - Points refresh annually with 5-year expiration (20% decay)
  - Points can be allocated to multiple levels of validation hierarchy

- **Validation Weighting**:
  - Organizations weighted by:
    - Number of supporting individuals
    - Total invested trust points
    - Validation score of point contributors

### 3.2 Voting Authority Framework

- **Registration Requirements**:
  - Identity verification
  - Transparency commitments
  - Vote explanation responsibilities
  - Member management capabilities

- **Hierarchical Structure**:
  - Individual → Organization → Coalition → Societal Governance
  - Domain-specific specialization (e.g., ADA under AMA example)
  - Ability to revoke delegation during review periods

- **Governance Responsibilities**:
  - Poll/ballot distribution to members
  - Vote explanation documentation
  - Override reporting
  - Resource allocation input

### 3.3 Economic System Integration ("Black Box")

- **Resource Allocation**:
  - 50,000 luxury units per employee annual distribution
  - Voucher system for necessities (food, healthcare, housing)
  - Maximum accumulation caps with redistribution
  - Public fund management through voting authorities

- **Reset Mechanisms**:
  - Continuous monitoring of maximum thresholds
  - Annual reallocation of points
  - Tax obligation tracking with automatic resets
  - Coalition decision-making on threshold adjustments

## 4. Data Structures

### 4.1 Core Entities

- **User Profile**:
  ```
  {
    userId: UUID,
    pseudonym: String,
    birthDate: Date,
    pointsAvailable: Number,
    pointsReceived: [PointTransaction],
    validationLevel: Number,
    familyConnections: [
      {
        userId: UUID,
        relationship: String,
        controlsPoints: Boolean
      }
    ],
    educationCredentials: [Credential]
  }
  ```

- **Voting Authority**:
  ```
  {
    authorityId: UUID,
    name: String,
    type: String, // organization, coalition, religious, political, etc.
    domain: [String], // areas of expertise/governance
    supporterCount: Number,
    totalTrustPoints: Number,
    weightedScore: Number,
    parentAuthorities: [AuthorityId],
    childAuthorities: [AuthorityId],
    consensusThreshold: Number
  }
  ```

- **Point Transaction**:
  ```
  {
    transactionId: UUID,
    fromUserId: UUID,
    toAuthorityId: UUID,
    pointAmount: Number,
    timestamp: Date,
    expiryDate: Date,
    signature: String
  }
  ```

- **Vote Record**:
  ```
  {
    voteId: UUID,
    legislation: {
      id: UUID,
      title: String,
      content: String,

    },
    implementationDate: Date
  }
  ```

### 4.2 Validation Hierarchy

- **Level 0**: Individual (1 point by default)
- **Level 1**: Organizations receiving direct individual trust points
- **Level 2**: Coalitions and domain authorities
- **Level 3**: Societal governance authorities
- Maximum of 10 levels in hierarchy to prevent excessive complexity

## 5. Process Workflows

### 5.1 Point Allocation Process

1. User authenticates into system
2. System displays available points balance
3. User selects voting authority and specifies amount (up to 1 point or 0.1 for religious/political)
4. System validates against allocation rules
5. Transaction is recorded in public ledger
6. Authority's validation score is updated

### 5.2 Voting Process

1. Voting authority creates legislation/ballot
2. System distributes to member hierarchy
3. Authorities cast weighted votes
4. System calculates review period based on urgency/impact
5. Votes and explanations published to public ledger
6. Individual members can override representative votes during review period
7. Final vote tally calculated after review period
8. Implementation scheduled based on outcome

### 5.3 Authority Consensus Formation

1. Authorities signal coalition willingness
2. Required threshold determined (minimum 33% for basic actions)
